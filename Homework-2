gdp <- read.csv('https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/sf-timeseries/data/gdp_bg_qrt_2000-2017.csv')
timeIndex <- as.yearqtr(gdp$Index, format = '%YQ%q')

gdpSeries <- xts(gdp$GDP, order.by = timeIndex)

## b)

plot(gdpSeries)

## The time series does not appear to be stationary since the variance seems to shift over time.
## The series does appear to have a seasonal pattern - this can also be observed if we decompose 
## the time series.

## c)

growthrateSeries <- diff(log(gdpSeries), 4)

## d)

plot(growthrateSeries)
## The growth rate series does not appear to follow a certain trend.
